# GeneticOpt
Deep learning network structure optimization

## About

This repositiry presents code for genetic optimization of neural network structure. 

## Using in python

In `GeneticOpt.py` you can find main code of the method with description.

`generate_date.py` contains code for loading and preprocessing data. Using datasets could be found in `datasets` folder.

To start structure optimization and see some information about output you should run the command:
```
python run_example.py
```
